# 1 - image classifier to detect birds
this notebook runs a resnet18 model to detect if a photo is of a bird or a forest.
  
the bulk of the code is downloading images from DuckDuckGo and putting them in folders called `forest` or `bird`. It then
uses the image's parent folder as a label for each image. 
  
the important code is: 
```python
dls = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]
).dataloaders(path)

dls.show_batch(max_n=6)
```
this creates a fastai object called `DataBlock`, a generic primitive used for fastai operations. this abstracts
away the handling of data and labeling so that different strategies can be used, such as file/folder labels, or csv's etc.
  
this code performs the fine-tuning.
```python
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(3)
```
  
this code uses the model to create a prediction for a new image.
```python
is_bird,_,probs = learn.predict(PILImage.create('bird.jpg'))
```
